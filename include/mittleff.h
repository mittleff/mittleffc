/**
 * Computes the Mittag-Leffler function
 *
 * @brief Evaluation of the Mittag-Leffler (ML) function with 2 parameters.
 *
 * @details Use the algorithm developed in [1].  The routine evaluates an
 * approximation \f$E_t\f$ of the ML function \f$E\f$ such that 
 *
 * \f{equation}{
 * |E - E_t|/(1 + |E|) \approx \textrm{tol}
 * \f}.
 * \p alpha must be a real and positive scalar and \p beta a real scalar. The
 * ML function is defined as
 *
 * \f{equation}{
 * E_{\alpha,\beta}(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^k}{\Gamma(\alpha\,k+\beta)}
 * \f}
